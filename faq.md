### How long are the sessions?

55 minutes.

### How much do sessions cost?

On average $120-$200. I also offer a sliding scale fee for client’s paying out of pocket. I also accept insurance. I am in network with BCBS PPO and accept other out of network insurances.

### Where are you located?

I am located in the Merchandise Mart at: 222 W Merchandise Mart Plaza in suite 4052 located within the Chicago School of Professional Psychology campus. The office is on the 4th floor and can be accessed by the “Wells St.” elevators.

### How do I get there?

Merchandise Mart is accessible by the Brown and Purple Lines. There are also several bus stops in the area.

### Is there parking?

There are two parking garages: Mart Parc Wells 401 N Wells St. & Mart Parc Orleans 437 N Orleans, St. Limited street parking is available in the area.

### Do you have a cancellation policy?

Yes, all cancellations must be made 24 hours prior to the appointment time. Any late cancellations and no shows are charged $75.

### Why weekly sessions?

Therapy is most effective when there is regular, consistent contact. Weekly appointments allow us to have the time to explore what is most pressing and concerning for you. Lengthy disruptions can make progress difficult. Our agreed upon appointment time is held for you each week and if you have a scheduling conflict, we do our best to reschedule.

### Are the sessions confidential?

All information shared in sessions are kept completely confidential. Only incidents of health and safety are when confidentiality cannot be maintained. This is to keep you and those around you safe. Our office is compliant with HIPPA rules and regulations.

### Do I need to bring anything to my first appointment?

Just yourself! All important information, payment, and insurance information, is collected during the initial intake phone call. Forms will be signed during the first appointment.
