### How long are the sessions?

45-55 minutes.

### How much do sessions cost?

I accept most insurances. The out of pocket rate for each session is $80. 

### Where are you located?

I am located at 1537 Riverside Ave. in Fort Collins. 

### Is there parking?

There is a small parking lot outside of the office and street parking available. 

### Do you have a cancellation policy?

Yes, all cancellations must be made 24 hours prior to the appointment time. Any late cancellations and no shows are charged $50.

### Why weekly sessions?

Therapy is most effective when there is regular, consistent contact. Weekly appointments allow us to have the time to explore what is most pressing and concerning for you. Lengthy disruptions can make progress difficult. Our agreed upon appointment time is held for you each week and if you have a scheduling conflict, we do our best to reschedule.

### Are the sessions confidential?

All information shared in sessions are kept completely confidential. Only incidents of health and safety are when confidentiality cannot be maintained. This is to keep you and those around you safe. Our office is compliant with HIPAA rules and regulations.

### Do I need to bring anything to my first appointment?

Just yourself! All important information, payment, and insurance information, is collected during the initial intake phone call. Forms will be signed during the first appointment.
