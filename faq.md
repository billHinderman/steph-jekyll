### How long are the sessions?

45-55 minutes.

### How much do sessions cost?

I accept most insurances. The out of pocket rate for each session is $95. 

### Where are you located?

Currently I am only offering Telehealth appointments.

When in person sessions resume, my office is located at 832 W Eisenhower Blvd Suite B1 Loveland, CO 80537

### Is there parking?

There is a parking lot outside of the office. The office is handicapped accessible. 

### Do you have a cancellation policy?

Yes, all cancellations must be made 24 hours prior to the appointment time. Any late cancellations and no shows are charged $75.

### Why weekly sessions?

Therapy is most effective when there is regular, consistent contact. Weekly appointments allow us to have the time to explore what is most pressing and concerning for you. Lengthy disruptions can make progress difficult. Our agreed upon appointment time is held for you each week and if you have a scheduling conflict, we do our best to reschedule.

### Are the sessions confidential?

All information shared in sessions are kept completely confidential. Only incidents of health and safety are when confidentiality cannot be maintained. This is to keep you and those around you safe. Our office is compliant with HIPAA rules and regulations.

### Do you offer free consultations?

Yes, the intake process starts with a free video or phone consultation that lasts approximately 15 minutes and allows time for us to meet each other and to answer any questions you have about starting therapy.

### Do I need to bring anything to my first appointment?

Just yourself! All important information, insurance, and payment, is collected through an online client portal. Telehealth appointments use the Simple Practice app which can be accessed on your smartphone or computer.  

### This is my first time using Telehealth, is it hard to use?

Telehealth appointments through Simple Practice are very user friendly and easy to set up. Here are some Telehealth tips:

Make sure your room/space is comfortable, private, and confidential
Find a good place to prop up your phone or computer
Make sure the screen shows your face and part of your upper body
Check to see that your camera and microphone are on
Make sure your phone and computer is charged and/or plugged in
Put your phone on “Do Not Disturb”
Headsets can help provide more privacy if you want to use them
Try to limit distractions such as TV, other devices, pets, roommates, children, etc. 
It’s ok to meet in a parked car, just don’t drive!
