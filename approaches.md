I believe that each person is their own unique individual and I will fit my approach to work with you in a warm, supportive, and collaborative way. We will work together to empower you to make positive changes in your life. My training and background includes Adlerian, Psychodynamic, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Humanistic/Existential, and Family Systems. The foundation of my approach is built on the therapeutic relationship and is insight oriented and emotionally based.
